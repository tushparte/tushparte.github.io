<p>We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often
depends on the quality of our habits. Maybe there are people who can achieve
incredible success overnight. I don&#39;t know any of them, and I&#39;m certainly not

It is a gradual evolution.</p>

There is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes the

1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-4">
WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Its so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and
underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too
often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
Wheather it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a
championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make
some earth shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile,
improving by 1 percent isn&#39;t particularly notable- sometimes it isn&#39;t even
noticeable- but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.
Here&#39;s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one
year, you&#39;ll end up thiry-seven times better by the time you&#39;re done.
Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you will decline
nearly down to zero. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. It is
only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of
good habits and cost of bad ones become strikingly apparent. If you go to the
gym three days in a row, you&#39;re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an
hour tonight, you still haven&#39;t learned the language. We make a few changes, but
the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous
routines. The slow place of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit
slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn&#39;t move mouch. If you
work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you
procrastinate and put your work of, you can still finish it later. But when we
repeat these errors day after day, but replicating poor decisions, our small
choices compound into toxic results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters
is whether your habits are putting you on the path towards success. You should
be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>

<p>Productivity compounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge compounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationships compound</p>
</li>

<p>Stress compound</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Outrage compounds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold
and unlock a new level of performance. You expect to make progress in a linear
fashion and it&#39;s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first
days, weeks, and even months. It doesn&#39;t feel like you are going anywhere. This
is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. In order
to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break
this plateau what author calls the <em>Plateau fo Latent Potential.</em> If you find
yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because
you have lost your ability to improve. Its often because you have not yet
crossed the plateau of Latent Potential.</p>

<h4 id="headline-5">
FOREGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we ant in life is to
set specific actionable goals. What&#39;s the difference between system and goals?
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes
that lead to those results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar
business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run
marketing campaigns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and
focused only on your system, would you still succeed? Yes, the only way to
actually win is to get better each day. The score takes care of itself. Goals
are good for setting direction, but systems are best for making progress. A
handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals
and not enough time designing your systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>If all successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal
cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.</p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That&#39;s the
counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our
results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to chage are
teh systems that cause those results. Fix the inputs and the ouputs will fix themselves.</p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: &#34;Once I reach my goal, then
I&#39;ll be happy.&#34;</p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The purpose of setting gaols is to win the game. The purpose of building systems
is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.
It&#39;s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless
refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the
process that will determine your progress.</p>

A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>If you&#39;re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn&#39;t you. The
problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again because you
don&#39;t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do
not rise to level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. This is
the meaning of phrase atomic habits- a regular practice or routine that is not
only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component
of the system of compound growth.</p>

2. How Your Habits Shape your Identity (and Vice Versa)
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days,
even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like
exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two
and then become a hassle.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We try to change the wrong thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We try to change our habits in the wrong way.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-8">
THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOUR CHANGE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The first layer is changing your outcomes.</strong> This level is concerned with
changing your results: losing weight, publishing a book, winning a
championship.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The second layer is changing your process.</strong> This level is concerned with
changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym,
decluttering your desk for a better workflow, developing a meditation
practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.</strong> This level is
concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your
judgements about yourself and others. Most of beliefs, assumptions and biases
you hold are associated with this level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is
about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last- when it
comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements- the problem is not that
one level is &#34;better&#34; or &#34;worse&#34; than another. All levels of change are useful
in their own way. Many people begin the process of changing their habits by
focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome based habits.
The alternative is to build identity based habits. With this approach, we start
by focusing on who we wish to become.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine two people resisting cigarettes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of a
democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social
equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like
absolute authority and strict obidience. A similar pattern exists whether we are
discussing individuals, organizations or societies. There are a set of beliefs
and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits. Behaviour
that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if
your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you will
continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. The ultimate form of
intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It&#39;s one
thing to say I&#39;m the type of person who wants this. It&#39;s something very
different to say I&#39;m the type of person who is this. True behaviour change is
identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only
reason you will stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal is not to learn a instrument, the goal is to become a musician.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Your behaviour are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an
indication of the type of person you believe you are- either consciously or
unconsciously. Once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity,
they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. The person who
incorporates exercise into their identity doesn&#39;t have to convince themselves to
train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behaviour and your
identity are fully alighned, you are no longer pursuing behaviour change. The
more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it
is to change it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-9">
THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day,
you embody the identity of an organized person. Whatever your identity is right
now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. If you go to church
every Sunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are religious. Of
course, your habits are not the only action that influence your identitym but by
virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and
deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No
single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does
the evidence of your new identity. The most practical way to change who you are
is to change what you do. It is a simple two-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decide the type of person you want to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prove it to yourself with small wins.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Many people are not sure where to begin- but they do know whay kind of results
they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double their
salary. Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of
person who could get those results.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step is now what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not
set in stone.</p>

WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-4">
<p>A habit is a behaviour that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Occasionaly, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution. You
are feeling anxious and you discover that going for a run calms you down. You&#39;re
mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing
videogames relaxes you. You are exploring, exploring, and then- BAM- a reward.
After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next
time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog events that preceded the reward.
<em>Wait a minute- that felt good. What did I do right before that?</em> This is the
feedback loop behind all human behaviour: try, fail, learn, try differently.
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-12" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-12">
THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The process of building habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue,
craving, response, and reward. Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can
help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it. This
four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs through
these steps in the same order each time.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to intitiate a behaviour.
It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Your mind is continuously
analysing your internal and external environment for hinds of where rewards
are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we&#39;re close to a
reward, it naturally leads to a craving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every
habit. Without some level of motivation or desire- without craving a change-
we have no reason to act. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the
feeling of relief it provides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perfrom,
which can take the form of a thought or a action. Whether a response occurs
depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the
behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every
habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the
reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>they satisfy us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they teach us. which actions are worth remembering in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally, but rather it
is an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every moment you
are alive- even now. We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem
phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the
craving, and it is when you realise that something needs to change. The solution
phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and
achieve the change you desire. All behaviour is driven by the desire to solve a
problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to
obtain it. Sometimes problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to
relive it.</p>

The 1st Law: Make it Obvious
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your
surroundings and analysing the information it comes across. Whenever you
experience something repeatedly- like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart
attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen- your
brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and
highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.
With enough practice, you can pick up on the ques that predict certain outcomes
without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the
lessons learnt through experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are
doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be
aware of your habits before you change them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness by verbalizing your
actions.</p>

5. The Best Way to start a New Habit
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>Create Implementation Intention:</strong>
Broadly speaking, the format of creating an implementation intention is: &#34;When
situation X arises, I will perform response Y.&#34; The punch line is clear: people
who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new babit are
more likely to follow through. Too many people try to change their habits
without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, &#34;I&#39;m going to eat
healthier&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m going to write more&#34;, but we never say when and where these
habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will &#34;just
remember to do it&#34; or feel motivated at the right time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It
is not obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire
lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The simplest way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this
sentence:
I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p>
</div>
<p>
We often say yes to little requests because we are often not clear enough about
what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it&#39;s easy to
rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to specific
things you need to do to succeed.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-18" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-18">
HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-4">
<p>No behaviour happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the
next behaviour. Why is this important? When it comes to building new habits, you
can use the connectedness of behaviour to your advantage. One of the best ways
to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do everyday and
then stack your new behaviour on top. This is called habit stacking.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The habit stacking formula is:
&#34;After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].&#34;</p>
</div>
<p>
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for
one minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my
workout clothes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your morning routine habit stacking might look like this:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my todo list for the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I write my todo list for the day, I will immediately begin with the
first task.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="headline-19">
6. Motivation is overrated; Environment Often matters more
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique
personalities, certain behavior tend to arise again and again under certain
environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark
street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change
is not internal, but externalL we are changed by the world around us. Every
habit is context dependent.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-20" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-20">
HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill
bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the
middle of the living room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of
stationary on your desk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and
place them in common locations around the house.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of
your environment. The most persistent behaviours usually have multiple cues. By
sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you
will think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the
most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for
good habits are right in front of you.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-21" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-21">
THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-4">
<p>For example, many people drink more in social situations than they would ever
drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation:
watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the
beers on tap.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>We mentally assign our habits to the location in which they occur: the home, the
office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and
routines. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour
each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats
a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people have different memories- and
this different habits- associated with the same place.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to
change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues
that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place- a different coffee
shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use- and create a
new routine there. Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on
autopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it
easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn&#39;t automatically know where
it is located.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>When you can&#39;t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or
rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise
and entertainment. The mantra I find useful is &#34;One space, one use.&#34; Whenever
possible avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start
mixing contexts, you&#39;ll start mixing habits- and the easier ones will usually
win out. This is one reson why the versatility of modern technology is both a
strength and a weakness.</p>

7. The Secret to Self-Control
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-23" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it
turns out those individuals aren&#39;t all that different form those who are
struggling. Instead, &#34;disciplined&#34; people are better at structuring their lives
in a way that does not require heroic will power and self-control. In other
words, they spend less time in tempting situations. The people with the best
self control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It&#39;s easier to
practice restraint when you don&#39;t have to use it very often. So, yes,
perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to
improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person,
but by creating a more disciplined environment.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the
feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat
junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you
watch more television because you don&#39;t have energy to do anything else.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>You can break a habit, but you&#39;re unlikely to forget it.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>A reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you can&#39;t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a
few hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&#39;re continually feeling like you are not enough, stop following social
media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of
latest tech gear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than <em>make it obvious,</em> you can <em>make it invisible.</em> Remove a single cue
and the entire habit often fades away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Self-control is a short term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to
resist temptation once or twice, but it&#39;s unlikely you can muster the willpower
to override your desires everytime. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower
whenever you want to do right thing, your energy would be better spent
optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make cues of
your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.</p>

8. How to Make a Habit Irresistible
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-25" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If you want to increase the odds that a behaviour will occur, then you need to
make it attractive. While it is not possible to transform every habit into a
supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must
start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>We begin by examining a boilogical signature that all habits share- the dopamine spike.</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-26" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-26">
THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-26" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly
habit-forming- taking drugs, eating junk food, playing videogames, browsing
social media- is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said
for our most basic habitual behaviours like eating food, drinking water, having
sex, and interacting socially. Dopamine is released not only when you experience
pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine
spike right before they place a bet. Whenever your dopamine rises, so does your
motivation to act. The reward system that is activated in the brain when you
recieve a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a
reward. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening
the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more
enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Your brain has far more neural
circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Desire is the engine that drives behaviour. Every action is taken because of the
anticipation that preceds it. It is the craving that leads to the response. We
need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding
experience that motivates us to act in the first place.</p>

HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-27" class="outline-text-4">
<p>You&#39;re more likely to find a behavior attracttive if you get to do one of your
favourite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the latest
celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you
could only read thte tabloids and watch reality shows at the gym.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known a Permack&#39;s
principle. It states that &#34;more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable
behaviors.&#34; Even if you don&#39;t really want to process overdue work emails,
you&#39;ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you
really want to do along the way. The habit stacking + temptation bundline formula
is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After [CURRENTT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After I pull out my phone, I will do 10 burpees (need).</p>

THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-29" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the
respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival.
We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or
school, our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and
groups comes with its own set of expectations and standards- when and whether to
get married, how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how much
money to spend on your child&#39;s birthday party. In many ways, these social norms
are the invisible rules that guide your behaviour each day. You are always
keeping them in mind. We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The close.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The many.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The powerful.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-30" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-30">
1. Imitating the Close
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-30" class="outline-text-4">
<p>We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with each
other, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give
it a try too. As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely
we are to imitate some of their habits. If one person in a relationship lost
weight, the other partner would also slim down about one third of the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a
culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour. New habits seem
achievable when you see others doing them everyday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a
personal quest into a shared one. Previously you were on your own. Your identity
was singular. <em>You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athelete.</em> When
you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked
to those around you. Growth and change is no longer a individual pursuit. <em>We
are readers.</em> The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-31" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-31">
2. Imitating the Many
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-31" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We
are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, &#34;What is everyone else
doing?&#34; We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to
imitate the &#34;best&#34; buying, eating and travel habits. It&#39;s usually a smart
strategy but there can be a downside. The normal behaviour of the trive often
overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. The human mind knows how to
get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural
mode. You can override it- you can choose to ignore the gorup or to stop caring
about what people think- but it takes work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-32" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-32">
3. Imitating the Powerful
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-32" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Humans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We are drawn to behaviour
that earn us respect approval, admiration, and status. We want to be the one in
the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord
progressions. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out. This is
one reasy we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. High
status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means
if a behaviour gets us these, we find it attractive. When our mother comes to
visit, we clean up house because we don&#39;t want to be judged. We are continually
wondering &#34;What will others think of me?&#34; and altering our behaviour based on
the answer.</p>

<h4 id="headline-34">
WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-34" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive. Some
of our underlying motives include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conserve energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain food and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find love and reproduce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect and bond with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win social acceptance and approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce uncertainity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve status and prestige.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your
brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or
to play videogames. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainity and
relive anxiety.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we
predict a habit to be worth repeating or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>CUE: You notice that the stove is hot.</p>
<p>
Prediction: If I touch it I&#39;ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.</p>
</div>
<p>
You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the
appropriate responce. Life feels reactive, but its actually predictive. All day
long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you&#39;ve just seen
and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predecting what will
happen in the next moment. These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we
typically describe a craving- a feeling, a desire, an urge. A craving is the
sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.
When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently
sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and
you desired state provides a reason to act.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want ot be in
the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel
differently than you do in the moment.</p>

<h4 id="headline-35">
HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-35" class="outline-text-4">
<p>You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with
a positive experience. Sometimes all you need is a slight mindset shift. For
instance you think you have to wake up early for work. Now imagine changing just
one word: You don&#39;t &#39;have&#39; to. You &#39;get&#39; to. By simply changing one word, you
shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviours
as burdens and turn them into opportunties.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Many people associate exercies with being a challenging tasks that
 drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to
 develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself &#34;I need to go run
 in the morning&#34;, say &#34;It&#39;s time to build endurance and get fast&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Say you want to feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truely
happy- like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath- and then create a short
routine that you perform everytime you do the thing you love. Maybe you take
three deep breaths and smile. Eventually you begin to associate this breathe and
smile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy.</p>

<p>It is easy to get bogged down to trying to find the optimal plan for change: the
fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea
for side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we
never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, &#34;The best is the

really, you are just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a
form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don&#39;t want to merely
be planning. You want to be practicing. You don&#39;t need to map out every feature
of a new habit. You just need to practice it.</p>

HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-38" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Habit formation is the process by which a behaviour becomes progressively more
automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the
structure of your brain changes to become efficient in that activity. Each time
you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated
with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most
critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. You should be asking how
many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic? There is nothing
magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. What matters is the
rate at which you perform the behaviour. It is the frequency that makes the
difference. To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective
way to make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behaviour Change:
make it easy.</p>

12. The Law of Least Effort
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-39" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if
you really wanted it, you&#39;d actually do it. But the truth is, our real
motivation is to be lazy and do what is convenient. And despite what the latest
productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb
one. Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever
possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort. We are motivated
to do what is easy.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Look at any behaviour that fills up much of your life and you&#39;ll see that it can
be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on your
phones, checking email, and watching television. They are remarkably convinient.
Every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an
obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling
is an obstacle to thinking clearly. If you make your good habits more
convenient, you&#39;ll be more likely to follow through on them.</p>

HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT

<div id="outline-text-headline-40" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Imagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some water can
flow through but not very much. If you want to increase the rate at which water
passes through the hose, you have two options. The first option is to crank up
the valve, the second option is to simply remove the bend and let the water
flow through naturally. Trying to pump up your motivaition to stick with a hard
habit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it
requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile
making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend. Rather than trying
to overcome friction in your life, try to reduce it. If you look at the most
habit-forming products, you&#39;ll notice that one of the things these goods and
services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery
services reduce the friction of shopping groceries. Dating apps reduce the
friction of making social introductions. The central idea is to create
environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.</p>

13. How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-42" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are
out of habit. This is already a substantail percentage, but the true influence
of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic
choices that influcene the conscious decisions that follow. Habits are like the
entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path, and before you know it,
you&#39;re speeding toward the next behaviour. Everyday, there are a handful of
moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as
decisive moments. The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your
bike. The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing the
videogame controller. These choices are fork in the road. We are limited by
where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the decisive moments throughout
your day is so important. Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They
are the cab, not the gym.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-43" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-43">
THE TWO-MINUTE RULE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-43" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The rule states, &#34;When you start a new habit, it should take less than two
minutes to do.&#34; You can scale any habit down to 2 minute version.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&#34;Read before bed at night&#34; becomes &#34;Read one page.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;Do thirty minutes of yoga&#34; becomes &#34;Take out my yoga mat.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;Study for class&#34; becomes &#34;Open my notes.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;Fold the laundry&#34; becomes &#34;Fold one pair of socks.&#34;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. A new habit should
not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the
first two minutes should be easy. People often think it&#39;s weird to get hyped
about reading one page or meditating for one minute. But the point is not to do
one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit
must be established before it can be improved. By doing the same warmup before
every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peek performance. By
developing a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a
reasonable time each night. Once you have established this habit, you can move
on to improve it further.</p>

<p>Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making
bad habits hard. If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through
on your plans, then you can take a page from Victor Hugo and make your habits
more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. A
commitment device is a choice you make in present that controls your actions in
the future. It is a way to lock in future behaviour, bind you to good habits,
and restrict bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus

of technology frees up time and energy to pour into  the next stage of growth.
There can be downsides to this too. I often find myself gravitating toward
social media during any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a
second, I reach for my phone. It&#39;s easy to write off these minor distractions as
&#34;just taking a break,&#34; but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue.

<h3 id="headline-48">
The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-48" class="outline-text-3">
<p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. Take
the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold commercially throughout the
1800s, but it wasn&#39;t until Wrigley launched in 1891 that it became a world wide
habit. Early versions were made from relatively bland resins- chewy, but not
tasty. Wrigley revolutionized the industry by adding flavours like Spearmint and
Juicy Fruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Stories like these
are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change: <em>What is rewarded is
repeated.</em> <em>What is punished is rewarded.</em> But there is a trick. We are not
looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate
satisfaction.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-49" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-49">
THE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED REWARDS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-49" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Our ancestors spent their days responding to grave threats, securing the next
meal, and taking shelter from the storm. It made sense to place a high value on
instant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And after
thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved
to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones. You value the present more than the
future. Usually, this tendancy serves us well. A reward that is certain right
now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But
occasionaly, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why
would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity? Once
you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the
consequences of bad habits are delayed while rewards are immediate. Smoking
might kill you in 10 years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine
cravings now. Overeating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the
moment. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the
ultimate outcome feels bad. It is opposite for good habits. Costs of your good
habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The brain&#39;s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can&#39;t rely on
good intentions. When you make a plan- to lose weight, write a book, or learn a
language- you are actually making plans for your future self. And when you
envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in
taking actions with long term benefits. We all want better lives for our future
selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification
usually wins. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an
action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long
term goals. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratisfaction.</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-headline-50" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-50">
HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-50" class="outline-text-4">
<p>In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real
world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you
with something. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to
remember it more than other phases. You want ending of your habit to be
satisfying. The best approach is to use <em>reinforcement,</em> which refers to the
process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of behavior.
Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying
when you finish. It can be helpful when dealing with <em>habits of aviodance,</em>
which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with
habits like &#34;no frivolous purchases&#34; because nothing happens when you don&#39;t buy
that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in
the first place. All you are doing is resisting temptation, and there isn&#39;t much
satisfying about that.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance
visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want- maybe
&#34;Leather Jacket.&#34; Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money
in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer Rs. 25. It&#39;s like creating a
loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money
toward the leather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are
makeing it satisfying to do nothing. Buying a new jacket is fine if you are
trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re trying
to budget and save money. It is worth noting that it is important to select
short term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict
with you. Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and
reduced stress kick in, you&#39;ll become less concerned with chasing secondary
reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it&#39;s who
you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life,
the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start
a habit. Identity sustains a habit.</p>

HOW TO RECOVER QUICKLY WHEN YOUR HABITS BREAK DOWN

<div id="outline-text-headline-53" class="outline-text-4">
<p>No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life
will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an
emergency will pop up- you get sick or you have to travel for work or your
family needs a little more of your time. Whenever this happens, try to remind
yourself of a simple rule: never miss twice. If I miss one day, I try to get
back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one workout happens, but I&#39;m not
going to miss two in a row. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you.
It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident.
Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature
between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout,
or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The
breaking of a habit doesn&#39;t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast. Furthermore,
it&#39;s not always about what happens during the workout. It&#39;s about being the type
of person who doesn&#39;t miss workouts. It&#39;s easy to train when you feel good, but
it&#39;s crucial to show up when you don&#39;t feel like it- even if you do less than
you hope. Going to the gym for five minutes may not improve your performance,

number rather than the purpose behind it. The human mind wants to &#34;win&#34; whatever
game is being played. This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on
working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about
getting ten thousand steps than we do about getting healthy. When we choose the
wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior. Measurement is only useful when it
guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each

<p>Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is
satisfying, we are more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is
painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed.
The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from
it. As soon as actions incure an immediate consequence, behavior begins to
change. Customers pay their bills on time when they are charged a late fee.
Students show up to calss when their grade is linked to attendance. To be
productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action.
To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise.
Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.

<div id="outline-text-headline-58" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of
competition. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,
when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Embracing this
strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people are born with
different abilities. The strenght of genetics is also their weakness. Genes
cannot easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in
favorable curcumstances and serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they
are well suited for the task. And that is why, if you want to be truly great,
selecting the right place is to focus is crucial.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of

you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more

HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-59" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation
to situation. The most proven scientific analysis of personality is known as the
&#34;Big Five&#34;, which breaks down to five spectrums of behavior.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one and to cautious and
consistent on the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm and stable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All five characteristics have biological underpinnings, can be tracked from
birth. As an example consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all
people posses to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be
anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been linked to
hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for
noticing threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues
in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Our habits are nto solely determined by our personalities, but there is no doubt
that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences
make certain behaviours easier for some people than for others. You don&#39;t have
to apologize for these differences or feel guilty for them, but you do have to
work with them. The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your
personality. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you find that low-fat
works for you, then more power to you. Read whatever fascinates you. You don&#39;t
have to build the habits everyone tells you to build.</p>

HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOUR
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-60" class="outline-text-4">
<p>How do you pick the right habit? In the long-run, if you continue to advance and
improve, any area can become challenging. At some point, you need to make sure
you&#39;re playing the right game for your skillset. How do you figure that out?</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The most common approach is trial and error. But life is short. There is an
effective way to manage this conundrum, and that is explore/exploit trade-off.
In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In
relationships, it&#39;s called dating. In college it&#39;s called the liberal arts. The
goal is to try out many possibilites, research a broad range of ideas, and cast
a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the
best solution you&#39;ve found- but keep experimenting occasionally. If you are
currently winning, you exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you
continue to explore, explore, explore. In the long-run it is probably effective
to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80-90
percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent.</p>
</div>
<p>
As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask
yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be
satisfying to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What makes me loose track of time?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where do I get greater returns than average person?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What naturally comes to me?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you can&#39;t win by being better, you can win by being different. Boiling
water will soften will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can&#39;t control
whether you&#39;re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it&#39;s
bette to be hard or soft.</p>

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES

<div id="outline-text-headline-61" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Biological differences matter. Even so, it&#39;s more productive to focus on whether
you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else.
The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do
with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capacity. People get so caught
up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effor required
to get close to them. Furthuremore, genes can&#39;t make you successful if your&#39;re
not doing the work. Yes, it&#39;s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has
better genes, but if you haven&#39;t put in the same reps, it&#39;s impossible to say if
you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as
those you admire, don&#39;t explain away their success as luck.</p>

19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-62" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working
on tasks that are right on the edge of their abilities. Not too hard. Not too
easy. Just right. When you are starting a new habit, it&#39;s important to keep
behaviour as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions
aren&#39;t perfect. Once a habit has been established, however it is important to
continue to advance in small ways. These improvements and new challenges keep
you engaged. And if you git the Goldilocks Zone just rihgt, you can achieve a
flow state. A flow state is the experience of being in the zone and fully
immersed in an activity. Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to
regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to
make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviours need to remain novel in
order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored.
And boredom is perhaps the greatest villian on the quest for self-improvement.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-63" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-63">
HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON YOUR GOALS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-63" class="outline-text-4">
<p>At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training everyday,
doing the same lifts over and over and over. Really successful people feel the
same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find
a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. Mastery requires practice. But
the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. The
greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits
because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. As soon as we
experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy-
even if the old one was still working. I can guarentee that if you manage to
start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like
quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don&#39;t feel like
showing up. Whne you are at the gym, there will be sets that you don&#39;t feel like
finishing. When it&#39;s time to write there will be days tat you don&#39;t feel like
typing. But stepping up when it&#39;s annoying or painful or draining to do so,
that&#39;s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose;
amateurs get pulled of course by urgencies in life.</p>

20. The Downside of Creating Good Habits
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-64" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops
fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as habit becomes automatic, you become less
sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomnes easier to
let mistakes slide. When you can do it &#34;good enough&#34; on autopilot, you stop
thinking about how to do it better.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Habits are necessary but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a
combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. But after one habit
ahs been mastered, you have to return to the efforful part of the work and begin
building the next habit. Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a
tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and
then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of
your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesn&#39;t
get easier overall because you are pouring your energy into the next challenge.
Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It&#39;s an endless cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of your
performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="headline-65">
HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-65" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it
makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible pahts for
improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations,
and like to overselves. Improvements is not just about learning habits, it&#39;s
about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time
on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary. You don&#39; t
want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reflections and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important
aspects of behaviour change: identity.</p>

HOW TO BREAK HABITS THAT HOLD YOU BACK
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-66" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and sticks with her
tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is commited to doing things
&#34;his way&#34;. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow
beyond it. One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of of your identity
an overwhelming portion of who you are. The more you let a single belief define
you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie
everthing up in being the point guard or the parter at the firm or whatever
else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If you&#39;re a vegan
and then develop a health condition that forces you to change your diet, you&#39;ll
have an identity crisis on your hands. Military veterans and forer entrepreneurs
report similar feelings. The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to
redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity
even if your particular role changes.</p>

<p>&#34;I&#39;m an athlete&#34; becomes &#34;I&#39;m the type of person who is metally tough and
loves a physical challenge.&#34;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into
previous patterns of thinking and acting- even when the world is shifting around
us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to
periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.</p>
