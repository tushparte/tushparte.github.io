            <description>The essentialist   Instead of making just a millimeter of progress in a million directions, begin to generate tremendous momentum towards accomplishing the things that are truly vital.
  Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.
 How many times have you reacted to a request by saying yes without really thinking about it?</description>

Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.</p>

The Way of the Essentialist
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The way of the Essentialist is the relentless pursuit of less but better. It&#39;s about pausing constantly to ask, &#34;Am I investing in the right activities?&#34; There are far more activites in the world than we have time and resources to invest in but most are trivial and few are vital.</p>
<p>
Essentialism is not about how to get more things done; it&#39;s about how to get the <em>right</em> things done. By investing in fewer things we have the satisfying experience of making significant progress in the things that matter the most. Essentialist rejects the idea that we can fit it all in.</p>
<p>
Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest point of contribution lies, then making exection of those things almost effortless.</p>

The Way of the Nonessentialist
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#39;t prioritize your life, someone else will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In our society we are punished for good behaviour (saying no) and rewarded for bad behavior (saying yes). It often leads to what the author calls &#34;the paradox of success&#34; summarized in 4 phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 1:</strong> When we really have clarity of purpose, it enables us to succeed at our endeavor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 2:</strong> When we have success, we gain a reputation as a &#34;go to person&#34; and we are presented with increased options and opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 3:</strong> When we have increased opportunties and options, which is actually code for demands upon our time and energies, it leads to diffused efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Phase 4:</strong> We become distracted from what would otherwise be our highest level of contribution.</p>

<p>The persuit of success can be a catalyst for failure</p>

Why Nonessentialism is everywhere
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-3">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Too many choices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Too much social pressure</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea that &#34;you can have it all&#34;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>We can either make our choices deliberately or allow other people&#39;s agendas to control our lives.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Essentialism is about creating a system for handling the closet of our lives. This is not a process you undertake once a year, once a month, or even once a week. It&#39;s a discipline you apply each and every time you are faced with a decision about whether to say yes or whether to politely decline. It&#39;s a method for making the tough trade-off between lots of good things and a few really great things.</p>

Road map
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-3">
<div id="outline-container-headline-6" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-6">
Step 1: explore
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Essentialists actually expore more options than their nonessentialist counterparts. Rather than virually committing to everything without actually exploring, essentialists explore and evaluate a broad set of options before committing to any.</p>
<p>
We aren&#39;t looking for plethora of good things to do. We are looking for our highest level of contribution: the right thing the right way at the right time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-7">
Step 2: eliminate
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>People are effective because they say &#39;no&#39;, because they say, &#39;this isn&#39;t for me&#39;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-8">
Step 3: execute
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-4">
<p>We tend to think of the process of execution as something hard and full of friction, something we need force to &#34;make happen&#34;. Instead of forcing execution, Essentialists invest the time they saved into creating a system for removing obstacles and making execution as easy as possible.</p>

Choose

<p>It is the ability to choose which makes us human.</p>

<p>
The ability to choose cannot be taken away or even given away - it can only be forgotten.</p>

<h3 id="headline-10">
How do we forget our ability to Choose ?
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-10" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Because of <strong>learned helplessness</strong>.</p>
<p>
To become an Essentialist requires a hightened awareness of our ability to choose.</p>

Discern
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Is there a point at which doing more does <em>not</em> produce more? Is there apoint at which doing <em>less</em> (but thinking more) will actually produce better outcomes?</p>
<p>
Certain types of effort yield higher rewards than others. Working hard is important. But more effort does not necessarily yield more results. &#34;Less but better&#34; does.</p>
<p>
World&#39;s greatest chef, Ferran Adria has led El Bulli to become the world&#39;s most famous restaurant using the principle of &#34;less but better&#34;. His specialty is reducing traditional dishes to their absolute essence and then re-imagining them in ways people have never thought of before. El Bulli has somewhere in the range of 2 million requests for dinner reservations each year, it serves only fifty people per night and closes for six months of the year.</p>
<p>
&#34;Less but better&#34; is harder than it sounds especially when you are rewarded in the past for &#34;more and more&#34;.</p>
<p>
&#34;Warren decided early in his career it would be impossible for him to make hundreds of right investment decisions, so he decided that he woul dinvest only in the business that he was absolutely sure of, and then bet heavily on them. He owes 90% of his wealth to just ten investments.&#34;</p>
<p>
According to &#34;power law theory&#34;, certain efforts actually produce exponentially more results than others.</p>
<p>
The overwhelming reality is: we live in a world where almost everything is worthless and a very few things are exceptionally valuable.</p>

<p>&#34;You cannot overestimate the unimportance of practically everything&#34; — John Maxwell</p>

Trade-off
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
You have to look at every opportunity and say, &#34;Well, no… I&#39;m sorry. We&#39;re not going to do a thousand different things that really won&#39;t contribute much to the end result we are trying to achieve.&#34;</p>
<p>
Look at the approach taken by Southwest airlines in their relentless pursuit of being a low-cost airline by making trade-offs of meals, firstclass service etc.</p>
<p>
Trade-offs are real, straddling strageies that force us to make sacrifices on the margins by default that we might not have made by desgin. The reality is, saying yes to any opportunity by definition requires saying no to several others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I didn’t start out with the goal of devoting all of myself to my job. It crept in over time. Each year that went by, slight modifications became the new normal. First I spent a half-hour on Sunday organizing my e-mail, to-do list, and calendar to make Monday morning easier. Then I was working a few hours on Sunday, then all day. My boundaries slipped away until work was all that was left.” — Erin Callan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We can either make the hard choices for ourselves or allow others to decide for us.</p>
<p>
<strong>We can try to avoid the reality of trade-offs, but we can&#39;t escape them.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I once worked with an executive team that needed help with their prioritization. They were struggling to identify the top five projects they wanted their IT department to complete over the next fiscal year, and one of the managers was having a particularly hard time with it. She insisted on naming eighteen “top priority” projects. I insisted that she choose five. She took her list back to her team, and two weeks later they returned with a list she had managed to shorten—by one single project! (I always wondered what it was about that one lone project that didn’t make the cut.) By refusing to make trade-offs, she ended up spreading five projects’ worth of time and effort across seventeen projects. Unsurprisingly, she did not get the results she wanted. Her logic had been: We can do it all. Obviously not.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A Nonessentialist approaches every trade-off by asking, &#34;How can I do both?&#34; Essentialists ask the thougher but ultimately more liberating question, &#34;What problem do I want?&#34;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;There are no solutions. There are only trade-offs&#34; — Thomas Sowell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Like the Southwest, we can enjoy the success that results from making a consistent set of choices.</p>
<p>
Essentialists see trade-offs as a inherent part of life, not as an inherently negative part of life. Instead of asking, &#34;What do I have to give up?&#34; they ask, &#34;What do I want to go big on?&#34;</p>

<p>
<strong>In order to have focus we need to escape to focus.</strong></p>

Space to concentrate

<div id="outline-text-headline-14" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Think of Sir Isaac Newton. He spent two years working on what became <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, his famous writings on universal gravitation and the three laws of motion. This period of almost solitary confinement proved critical in what became a true breakthrough that shaped scientific thinking for the next three hundred years.</p>
<p>
It seems obvious, but when did you last take time out of your busy day simply to sit and think? I&#39;m talking about deliverately setting aside distraction-free time in a distraction-free space to do absolutely nothing other than think.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-4">
<p>
Whether you can invets two hours a day, two weeks a yaer, or even just five minutes every morning, it is important to make space to escape in your busy life.</p>
<p>

Look
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
<strong>See What Really Matters</strong></p>
<p>
Being a journalist of your own life will force you to stop hyper-focusing on all the minor details and see the bigger picture. You can apply the skills of a journalist no matter what field you are in—you can even apply them to your personal life. By training yourself to look for “the lead,” you will suddenly find yourself able to see what you have missed. You’ll be able to do more than simply see the dots of each day: you’ll also connect them to see the trends. Instead of just reacting to the facts, you’ll be able to focus on the larger issues that really matter.</p>
<p>
Essentialists are powerful observers and listeners. Knowing that the reality of trade-offs means they can&#39;t possibly pay attention to everything, they listen deliberately for what is not being explicitly stated. They read between the lines.</p>

Play
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
“Play, which I would define as anything we do simply for the joy of doing rather than as a means to an end—whether it’s flying a kite or listening to music or throwing around a baseball—might seem like a nonessential activity. Often it is treated that way. But in fact play is essential in many ways. Stuart Brown, the founder of the National Institute for Play, has studied what are called the play histories of some six thousand individuals and has concluded that play has the power to significantly improve everything from personal health to relationships to education to organizations’ ability to innovate. “Play,” he says, “leads to brain plasticity, adaptability, and creativity.” As he succinctly puts it, “Nothing fires up the brain like play.”</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Play broadens the range of options available to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It helps us to see the possibilities we otherwise wouldn&#39;t have made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It opens our minds and broadens our perspectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It helps us challenge old assumptions and makes us more receptive to untested ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is an antidote to stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Play has a positive effect on the executive function of the brain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Play doesn&#39;t just help us to explore what is essential. It is essential in and of itself.</p>

Protecting the asset
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
The best asset we have for making a contribution to the world is <em>ourselves</em>. If we underinvest in ourselves, and by that I mean our minds, our bodies, and our spirits, we damage the very tool we need to make our highest contribution. One of the most common ways people - especially ambitious, successful people - damage this asset is through a lack of sleep.</p>
<p>
For a type A personality, it is not hard to push oneself hard. Pushing oneself to the limit is easy. The real challenge for the person who thrives on challenges is not to work hard.</p>
<p>
Sleep is not the enemy of productivity, in fact sleep is the driver of peak performance.</p>
<p>
While there clearly are people who can survive on fewer hours of sleep, most of them are just used to being tired they have forgotten what it really feels like to be fully rested.</p>
<p>
While we sleep our brains are hard at work encoding and restructuring information. Therefore when we wake up, our brains may have made new neural connections, thereby opening up a broader range of solutions to problems, literally overnight. Sleep is what allows us to operate at our highest level of concetration so that we can achieve more, in less time.</p>

Anyone can talk about focusing only on essentials, but only a few dare to do so. There are good reasons against saying no. There is FOMO, social awkwardness, the human want to get along with others.</p>
<p>
The only way out of this trap is to learn to say no firmly, resolutely, and yet gracefully. Once we do so, we find that our fears are greatly exaggerated and people actually respect us more.</p>

<p>
Sunk cost explains why we would sit through a terrible movie because we paid for the tickets. It explains why we invest in a toxic relationship even when our efforts only make things worse.</p>
<p>
A nonessentialist has the courage and confidence to admit his or her mistakes and uncommit, no matter the sunk costs.</p>

Avoiding Commitment Traps
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-30" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
<strong>Endowment Effect</strong>: our tendancy to undervalue things that aren&#39;t ours and to overvalue things because we already own them.</p>
<p>
Think about the book in your shelves that you haven&#39;t read in years, the clothes that you never wore. Instead of asking &#34;How much I value this item?&#34; ask &#34;If I did not own this item, how much would I pay to obtain it?&#34;.</p>
<p>
Only when we admit we have made a mistake in commiting to something can we make a mistake a part of our past. There should be no shame in admitting to a mistake; after all, we really are only admitting that we are now wiser than we once were.</p>
<p>
<strong>Status Quo Bias</strong>: the tendancy to continue doing something simply because we have always done it is sometimes called the &#34;status quo bias.&#34; An antidote to status quo bias is <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/z/zbb.asp">zero-based budgeting</a>.</p>

Boundaries are a little like walls of a sandcastle. The second we let one fall over, the rest of them come crashing down. If you make a exception once, then you might have made it several times.</p>
<p>
Remember, their problem is not your problem. We sure should help other people, but when they make their problem our problem, we aren&#39;t helping them; we are enabling them.</p>

When we have clear boundaries, we are free to select from the whole area - or the whole range of options - that we have deliberately chosen to explore.</p>

Buffer

<div id="outline-text-headline-35" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
Invest time you have saved by eliminating the nonessentials into designing a system to make execution almost effortless. Here we explore how to make executing the right things as easy and frictionless as possible.</p>
<p>
We live in a unpredictable world. The only thing that is pridictable is the unexpected. We can either wait for the moment and react or we can prepare. We can create a buffer.</p>
<p>
A buffer is anything that prevents two things from coming into contact and harming each other.</p>
<p>
We all know those people who chronically underestimate how long something will really take, yet inevitably these things end up taking longer. When this happens they are reacting to the problem and hence results suffer.</p>
<p>
As an essentialist you have to look ahead and prepare for contingencies, expect the unexpected. You have to use the good times to create a buffer for the bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use <strong>extreme preparation</strong>.</p>

Progress

<div id="outline-text-headline-37" class="outline-text-2">
<p>
The nonessentialist operates under the false logic that the more he strives, the more he will achieve, but the reality is, the more we reach for the stars, the harder it is to get ourselves off the ground. The essentialist pursues small and simple wins in areas that are essential.</p>
<p>
Research has shown that of all forms of human motivation teh most effective one is progress. A small, concrete win creates momentum and affirms our faith in our further success.</p>
<p>
Instead of starting big and then flaring out with nothing to show for it other than time and energy wasted, to really get essential things done we need to start small and build momentum. Then we can use that momentum to work toward the next win, and the next one and so on until we have a significant breakthrough - and when we do, our progress will have become so frictionless and effortless that the breakthrough will seem like overnight success.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>focus on minimal viable progress (done is better than perfect).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do the minimal viable preparation (start early and small or start late and big).</p>

Making it look easy
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-39" class="outline-text-3">
<p>
Routine is one of the most powerful tools for removing obstacles. Create a routine around the essentials and you only have to execute them on autopilot. Instead of consciously the essential, it will happen without our having to think about it.</p>
<p>
Mihaly demonstrates how creative people have strict routines to free up their minds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most creative individuals find out early what their best rythms are for sleeping, eating, and working, and abide by them even when it is tempting to do otherwise. They wear clothes that are comfortable, they interact only with people they find congenial, they do only things they think are important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Personalizing patterns of actions helps free the mind from the expectations that make demands on attention and allows intense concentration on matters that count.</p>
<p>
This section repeats advice from &#34;Atomic Habits&#34; and &#34;The Power of Habit&#34;.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>do the most difficult thing first. &#34;We already have too much to think about. Why not eliminate some of them by establishing a routine?&#34;</p>

Essentialism can be something you do occasionally, or something you are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less but better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There is a big difference between a nonessentialist who happens to apply essentialism and a essentialist who occasionally slips back to some nonessentialist practices.</p>
<p>
People with essentialism at their core get far more from their investment than those who absorb it only at the surface level. When we look back on our careers and our lives, would we rather see a long laundry list of &#34;accomplishments&#34; that don&#39;t really matter or just a few major accomplishments that have real meaning and significance?</p>
<p>
Once you become a essentialist, you will find that you aren&#39;t like everybody else. When we look back on our careers and our lives, would we rather see a long laundry list of &#34;accomplishments&#34; that don&#39;t really matter or just a few major accomplishments that have real meaning and significance?</p>
<p>
Once you become a essentialist, you will find that you aren&#39;t like everybody else. When other people are saying yes, you will find yourself saying no.</p>
<p>
Focusing on essentials is a choice. It is your choice. That in itself is liberating.</p>
<p>
<strong>Some benefits of essentialism</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>more clarity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>more joy in the journey</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally quoting the last section of the book:</p>
<p>
The life of an Essentialist is a life of meaning. It is a life that really matters.
When I need a reminder of this I think of a story. It is about a man whose three-year-old daughter died. In his grief he put together a video of her short little life. But as he went through all of his home videos he realized something was missing. He had taken video of every outing they had gone on and every trip they had taken. He had lots of footage—that wasn’t the problem. But then he realized that while he had plenty of footage of the places they had gone—the sights they had seen, the views they had enjoyed, the meals they had eaten, and the landmarks they had visited—he had almost no close-up footage of his daughter herself. He had been so busy recording the surroundings he had failed to record what was essential.
This story captures the two most personal learnings that have come to me on the long journey of writing this book. The first is the exquisitely important role of my family in my life. At the very, very end, everything everything else will fade into insignificance by comparison. The second is the pathetically tiny amount of time we have left of our lives. For me this is not a depressing thought but a thrilling one. It removes fear of choosing the wrong thing. It infuses courage into my bones. It challenges me to be even more unreasonably selective about how to use this precious—and precious is perhaps too insipid of a word—time. I know of someone who visits cemeteries around the world when he travels. I thought this was odd at first, but now I realize that this habit keeps his own mortality front and center.</p>
<p>
The life of an Essentialist is a life lived without regret. If you have correctly identified what really matters, if you invest your time and energy in it, then it is difficult to regret the choices you make. You become proud of the life you have chosen to live.
Will you choose to live a life of purpose and meaning, or will you look back on your one single life with twinges of regret? If you take one thing away from this book, I hope you will remember this: whatever decision or challenge or crossroads you face in your life, simply ask yourself, “What is essential?” Eliminate everything else.
If you are ready to look inside yourself for the answer to this question, then you are ready to commit to the way of the Essentialist.</p>

The War of Art
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-1" class="outline-text-2">
<p>To begin book one, Pressfield labels the enemy of creativity Resistance, his
all-encompassing term for what Freud called the Death Wish- that destructive
force inside human nature that rises whenever we consider a tough, long-term
course of action that might do for us or others that&#39;s actually good. He then
presents a rogue&#39;s gallery of the many manifestations of Resistance.</p>
<p>
In the second book, Pressfield lays out the day-by-day, step-by-step campaign of
the professional: preparation, order, patience, endurance, acting in the face of
fear and failure- no excuses, no bullshit.</p>
<p>
Book three, looks at Inspiration, that sublime result that blossoms in the
furrows of the professional who straps on the harness and plows the filds of his
or her art.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don&#39;t, and the
secret is this: It&#39;s not the writing part that&#39;s hard. What&#39;s hard is sitting
down to write. What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.</p>

THE UNLIVED LIFE
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-2" class="outline-text-2">
<p>Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us.
Between the two stands resistance. Late at night have you experienced a vision
of the person you might become, the work you could accomplish, the realized
being you were meant to be? Are you a writer who doesn&#39;t write, a painter who
doesn&#39;t paint, an entrepreneur who never starts a venture? Then you know what
resistance is.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resistance is the most toxic force on the planet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you heard this story: Woman learns that she has cancer, six months to live.
Within days she quits her job, resumes the dream of writing Tex-Mex songs she
gave up to raise a family (or starts studying classical Greek, or moves to the
inner city and devotes herself to tending babies with AIDS). Woman&#39;s friends
think she&#39;s crazy; she herself has never been happier. There&#39;s a postscript.
Woman&#39;s cancer goes into remission. So is it what it takes?</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="headline-3">
BOOK ONE: RESISTANCE DEFINING THE ENEMY
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<p>It&#39;s a repelling force. It&#39;s negative. Its aim is to shove us away, distract us,
prevent us from doing our work. Resistance is not a peripheral opponent. It
arises from within. It will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work.
It will reason with you like a lawyer or jam a nine-milimeter in your face like
a stickup man. It is always lying and always full of shit. </p>
<p>
The more important it is, the more resistance you will feel. The fear doesn&#39;t go
away. The warrior and the artist live by the same code of necessity, which
dictates that the battly must be fought anew everyday.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Resistance is most powerful at the finsh line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Resistance recruits allies.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The highest treason a crab can commit is to make a leap for the rim of the bucket.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The best and the only thing one artist can do for another is to serve as an
example and insipiration.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Procrastination is the most common manifestation of resistance because it&#39;s
the easiest to rationalize.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We don&#39;t just put off our lives today; we put them off till our deathbed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never forget: This very moment, we can change our lives. There never was a
moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny.
This second we can turn the tables on Resistance. This second, we can sit down
and do our work.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The working artist will not tolerate trouble in her life because she knows
trouble prevents her from doing her work. The working artist banishes from her
world all sources of trouble. She harnesses the urge for trouble and
transforms it in her work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resistance and Self-Dramatization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating soap opera in our lives is a symptom of resistance. Why put in years of
work designing a new software interface when you can get just as much attention
by bringing home a boyfriend with a prison record? Sometimes entire families
participate unconsciously in a culture of self-dramatization.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Depression and anxiety may be real. But they can also be resistance. Instead
of applying self-knowledge, self-discipline, delayed gratification, and hard
work, we simply consume a product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctors estimate that seventy to eighty percent of their business is
non-health-related. People aren&#39;t sick, they&#39;re self-dramatizing. Sometimes
the hardest part of a medical job is keeping a straight face.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A victim act is a form of passive aggression. It seeks to achieve gratification
not by honest work or a contribution made out of one&#39;s experience or insight or
love, but by the manipulation of others through silent (and not-so-silent)
threat. The victim compels others to come to her rescue or to behave as she
wishes by holding them hostage to the prospect of her own further
illness/meltdown/mental dissolution, or simply by threatening to their lives so
miserable that they do what she wants.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, if we are not conscious of our own resistance, we will pick as a
mate someone who has or is successfully overcoming resistance. Maybe we are
hoping to use our mate as a model.</p>

What does Resistance feel like?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unhappiness. We feel bored, we&#39;re restless, We can&#39;t get no satisfaction.
There&#39;s guilt but we can&#39;t put our finger on the source. We want to go back to
bed; we want to get up and party. We feel unloved and unlovable. We are
disusted. We hate our lives. We hate ourselves. At this point vice kick in.
Dope, adultery, web surfing. Resistance becomes clinical. Depression,
aggression, dysfunction. Then actual crime and physical self-distruction.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-headline-5" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-5">
Resistance and Fundamentalism?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The artist and the fundamentalist both confront the same issue, the mystery of
their existence as individuals. Each asks the same questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Who am I?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why am I here?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the meaning of my life?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At more primitive stages of evolution, humanity didn&#39;t have to deal with such
questions. These are not easy questions. They&#39;re not easy because the human
being isn&#39;t wired to function as an individual. We&#39;re wired tribally, to act as
part of a group. Our psyches are programmed by millions of years of
hunter-gatherer evolution. We don&#39;t know how to be free individuals.</p>
<p>
Fundamentalism is the philosophy of the powerless, the conquered, the displaced
and the dispossessed. Its spawning ground is the wreakage of political and
military defeat, as Hebrew fundamentalism arose during the Babylonian captivity,
as white Cristian fundamentalism appeared in the Americal South during
Reconstruction, as the notion of the Master Race evolved in Germany following
World War I. In such desperate times, the vanquished race would perish without
a doctorine that restored hope and pride. Islamic fundamentalism ascentds from
the same landscape of despair and possesses the same tremendous and potent
appeal. He cannot find his way into the future, so he retreats to the past. He
returns in imagination to the glory days of his race and seeks to recontitute
both them and himself in their purer, more virtuous light. He gets back to
basics. To fundamentals. Resistance to the fundamentalist is the call of the
Evil One, seeking to seduce hum form his virtue. The fundamentalist is consumed
with Satan, whom he loves as he loves death. To combat the call of sin i.e.
Resistance, the fundamentalist plunges either into action or into the study of
sacred texts. He loses himself in these, seeking to return to a purer world from
which he and all have fallen.</p>
<p>
The humanist belives that humankind, as individuals, is called upon to co-create
the world with God. This is why he values human life so highly. In his view,
things do progress, life doesn evolve; each indiviudal has value,a t least
potentially, in advancing this cause.</p>
<p>
When fundamentalism wins, the world enters a dark age.</p>
<p>
It may be that human race is not ready for freedom. The air of liberty may be
too rarefied for us to breathe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#34;The truely free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery&#34;
— Socrates</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern
over them.</p>

<h4 id="headline-6">
Resistance and Criticism
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>When we see others beginning to live their authentic lives, it drives us crazy
if we have not lived out our own.</p>
<p>
Individuals who are realised in their own lives almost never criticize others.
If they speak at all, it is to offer encouragement. Watch yourself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-7">
Resistance and Self-Doubt
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Self-doubt can be an ally. This is because it serves as an indicatore of
aspiration. If you find yourself asking yourself (and your friends, &#34;Am I really
a writer? Am I really an artist&#34; chances are you are.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-8" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-8">
Resistance and Fear
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-8" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Are you paralyzed with fear? That&#39;s a good sign.</p>
<p>
Fear is good. Like self-doubt, fear is an indicator, it tells us what we have to
do. The more scared we are of a work or calling, the more sure we can be that we
have to do it.</p>

<div id="outline-container-headline-9" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-9">
Resistance and Love
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Resistance is directly proportional to love. If you are feeling massive
resistance, teh good news is, it means there&#39;s tremendous love there too. If you
didn&#39;t love the project that is terrifying you, you wouldn&#39;t feel anything. The
opposite of live isn&#39;t hate; it&#39;s indifference.</p>

Resistance and Isolation

<p>Sometimes we balk at embarking on an enterprise because we&#39;re afraid of being
alone. We feel comfortable with the trive arond us; it makes us nervous going

Resistance and Healing

<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The athlete knows the day will never come when he wakes up pain-free. He has to
play hurt. The part of us we imagine needs healing is not the part we create
from; that part is far deeper and stronger. The part that needs healing is our
personal life. Personal life has nothing to do with work. Resistance loves
&#34;healing&#34;. Resistance knows that the more psychic energy we expend dredging and
re-dredging the tired, boring injustices of our personal lives, the less juice
we have to do our work.</p>

Resistance and Support
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-13" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Seeking support from friends and family is like having people gathered around at
your deathbed. It&#39;s nice, but when the ship sails, all they can do is stand at
the dock waving goodbye. The more energy we spend stoking up on support from
colleagues and loved ones, the weaker we become and the less capable of handling
our business.</p>

Resistance and Rationalization

<blockquote>
<p>Aw, come on! Nothing&#39;s more important than sex.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>have you ever gone a week without rationalization?</p>
<p>
Resistance is fear. But resistance is too cunning to show itself naked in this
form. Why? Because if resistance lets us see clearly that our own fear is
preventing us form doing our work, we may feel shame on this. It doesn&#39;t want
this. So it brings in Rationalization. It presents us with a series of
plausible, rational justifications for why we shouldn&#39;t do our work and it makes sense.</p>

BOOK TWO: COMBATING RESISTANCE. Turning Pro
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-15" class="outline-text-3">
<blockquote>
<p>It is one thing to study war and another thing to live the warrior&#39;s life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aspiring artists defeated by Resistance share one trait. They all think like
amateurs. They have not yet turned pro.</p>
<p>
To be clear: When the author says professional, he doesn&#39;t mean doctors and
lawyers. He means the Professional as an ideal. The amateur plays for fun. The
professional plays for keeps. The amateur plays part-time, the professional
full-time. The amateur is a weekend warrior, the professional is there seven
days a week. The amateur does not love the game enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Someone once asked Somerset Maugham if he wrote on a schedule or only when stuck
by inspiration. &#34;I write only when inspiration striks,&#34; he replied. &#34;Fortunately
it strikes every morning at nine o&#39; clock sharp.&#34;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Be aware of the Principle of Priority, which states</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you must know the difference between what is urgent and what is important</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you must do what is important first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What is important is work. That&#39;s the game I have to suit up for.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We may take pride in our work, we may stay late and come in on weekends, but we
recognize that we are not our job descriptions. The amateur, on the other hand,
overidentifies with his avocation, his artistic aspiration. He defines himself
by it. He is a musician, a painter, a play wright. Resistance loves this.
Resistance knows that the amateur composer will never write his symphony because
he is overly invested in its success and overterrified of its failure. The
amateur takes it so seriously it paralyzes him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
How does an amateur pursue his calling?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>He does not show up everyday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does not show up no matter what.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does not stay on the job all day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He is not committed over the long haul.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The stakes for him are illusory and fake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He does not get money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He overidentifies with his art.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amateur hasn&#39;t mastered the technique of his art.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing is as empowering as real-world validation, even if it&#39;s for failure</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The professional, though he accepts moeny, does his work out of love. He has to
love it. Otherwise he wouldn&#39;t devote his life to it of his own free will.</p>
<p>
It uses his own enthusiasm againt him. Resistance gets us to plunge into a
project with an overambitious and unrealistic timetable for its completion. It
knows we can&#39;t sustain that level of intensity. We will hit the wall, we will
crash.</p>
<p>
The professional arms himself with patience, not only to give the stars time to
align in his career, but to keep himself from flaming out in each individual
work. The professional shuts up. She doesn&#39;t talk about it. She does her work.</p>
<p>
The amateur believes he must first overcome his fear; then he can do his work.
The professional knows that fear can never be overcome. He knows there is no
such thing as a fearless warrior or a dread-free artist.</p>
<p>
The professional knows that resistance is like a telemarketer; if you so much as
say hello, you&#39;re finished. The pro doesn&#39;t even pick up the phone. He stays at
work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A professional, does not show off.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A professional dedicates himself to mastering the technique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A professional does not hesitate to ask for help.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A professional does not take failure (or success) personally. The professional
cannot let himself take humilation perosnally. Humiliation, like rejection and
criticism, is the external reflection of internal Resistance. The professional
keeps his eye on the doughnut and not on the hole. He reminds himself it&#39;s
better to be in the arena, getting stomped by the bull, than to be up in the
stands or out in the parking lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A professional self-validates. He cannot allow the actions of others to define
his reality. Tomorrow morning the critic will be gone but the writer will
still be there facing the blank page. Nothing matters but that he keep
working. He learns to recognize every envy-driven criticism and to take it for
what it is: the supreme compliment. The critic hates most that which he would
have done himself if he had the guts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A professional recognizes her limitations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A professional is recignized by other professionals.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There&#39;s no mystery to turning pro. It&#39;s a decision brought about by an act of
will. We make up our mind to view ourselves as pros and we do it. Simple as that.</p>

<p>The next few chapers are going to be about those invisible psychic forces that
support and sustain us in our journey towards ourselves.</p>

Nothing else matters except sitting down everyday and trying. Because when we

A process is set into motion by which, inevitably and fallibly, heaven comes to

<p>The moment a person learns he&#39;s got terminal cancer, a profound shift takes
place in his psyche. At one stroke in the doctor&#39;s office he becomes aware of
what really matters to hi. Things that sixty seconds earlier had seemed all
important suddenly appear meaningless, while people and concerns that he had
till then dismissed at once take on supreme importance.</p>
<p>
Maybe, he realizes, working this weekend on that big deal at the office isn&#39;t
all that vital. Maybe it&#39;s more important to fly cross-country for his
grandson&#39;s graduation. maybe it isn&#39;t so crucial that he have the last word in

FEAR
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Fear is the consequence of following our heart. Fear of backruptcy, fear of
poverty, fear of insolvency. Fear of groveling when we try to make it on our
own.</p>
<p>
All of these and many more are serious fears. But they are not the real fear.
Not the Master Fear, the Mother of all Fears that&#39;s so close to us that even
when we verbalize it we don&#39;t believe it.</p>
<p>
Fear That We Will Succeed.
That we can access the powers we secretly know we posses.
That we can become the person we sense in our hearts we truely are.</p>
<p>
We fear discovering that we are more than we think we are. More than our
parents/children/teachers think we are. We fear that we actually posses the
talent that our still, small voice tells us. That we actually have the guts, the
perseverance, the capacity. We fear that we truely can steer our ship, plant our
flag, reach our Promised Land.</p>
<p>
We know that if we embrace our ideals, we must prove to be worth of them. And
that scares the hell out of us. What will become of us? We will lose our friends
and family, who will no longer recognize is. We will wind up alone, in the cold
void of starry space, with nothing and no one to hold on to.</p>
<p>
We wind up in space, but not alone, Instead we are tapped into an unquenchable,
undepletable, inexhaustible source of wisdom, consciousness, companionship. Yeah
we lose friends. But we find friends too, in places we never thought to look.
And they&#39;re better friends, truer friends. And we are better and truer to them.</p>

The Authentic Self
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-22" class="outline-text-4">
<p>None of use are born as passive generic blobs waiting for the world to stamp its
imprint to us. Instead we show up possessing already a highly refined and
individual soul. We are not born with unlimited number of choices. We can&#39;t be
anything we want to be. We come into this world with a specific, personal
destiny. We have a job to do, a calling to enact, a self to become.</p>
<p>
Our job in this lifetime is not to shape ourselves into some ideal we imagine we
outght to be, but to find out who we already are and become it.</p>

The Artist and the Territory
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-24" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The act of creation is by definition territorial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of any activity, you do, ask yourself: If I were the last person on earth, would
I still do it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When Krishna instructed Arjuna that we have a right to our labor but not to the
fruits of our labor, he was conseling the warrior to act territorially, not
hierarchically. We must do our work for its own sake, not for fortune or
attention or applause.</p>
<p>
To labor in this way, <em>The Bhagvad-Gita</em> tells us, is a form of meditation and a
supreme species of spiritual devotion. It also, I belive, conforms most closely
to Higher Reality.</p>
<p>
Every breath we take, every heartbeat, every evolution of every cell comes from
God and is sutained by God every seocnd, just as every creation, invention,
every bar of music or line of verse, every thought, vision, fantasy, every
dumb-ass flop and stroke of genious comes from that infinite intelligence that
created us and the universe in all its dimensions, out of the Void, the field of
infinite potential, primal chaos, the Muse. To acknowledge that reality, to
efface all ego, to let the work come through us and give it back freely to its
source, that, in my opinion is as true to reality as it get.</p>

<p>Are you a born writer? Were you put on earth to be a painter, a scientist, an
apostle of peace? In the end the question can only be answered by action.</p>
<p>
Do or don&#39;t do it.</p>
<p>
If you were meant to cure cancer or write a symphony or crack cold fusion and
you don&#39;t do it, you not only hurt yourself, even distroy yourself. You hurt
your children. You hurt me. You hurt the plant.</p>
<p>
Creative work is not a selfish act or a bid for attention on the part of the
actor. It&#39;s a gift to the world and every being in it. Don&#39;t cheat us of your
contribution. Give us what you&#39;ve got.</p>

<p>We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often
depends on the quality of our habits. Maybe there are people who can achieve
incredible success overnight. I don&#39;t know any of them, and I&#39;m certainly not
one of them. There is no one defining moment on your journey but there are many.
It is a gradual evolution.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The backbone of this book is four-step model of habits- cue, craving, response,
and reward. This book is about what doesn&#39;t change. It&#39;s about the fundamentals
of human behaviour. The lasting principles you can rely on year after year.
There is no one right way to create better habits, but this book describes the
best way author knows- an approach that will be effective regardless of where
you start or what you are trying to change.</p>

1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-3" class="outline-text-3">
<div id="outline-container-headline-4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-4">
WHY SMALL HABITS MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-4" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Its so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and
underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too
often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
Wheather it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a
championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to make
some earth shattering improvement that everyone will talk about. Meanwhile,
improving by 1 percent isn&#39;t particularly notable- sometimes it isn&#39;t even
noticeable- but it can be far more meaningful, especially in the long run.
Here&#39;s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent better each day for one
year, you&#39;ll end up thiry-seven times better by the time you&#39;re done.
Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one year, you will decline
nearly down to zero. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. It is
only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of
good habits and cost of bad ones become strikingly apparent. If you go to the
gym three days in a row, you&#39;re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin for an
hour tonight, you still haven&#39;t learned the language. We make a few changes, but
the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into our previous
routines. The slow place of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit
slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the scale doesn&#39;t move mouch. If you
work late tonight and ignore your family, they will forgive you. If you
procrastinate and put your work of, you can still finish it later. But when we
repeat these errors day after day, but replicating poor decisions, our small
choices compound into toxic results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters
is whether your habits are putting you on the path towards success. You should
be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Productivity compounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Knowledge compounds</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationships compound</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stress compound</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative thoughts compound</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outrage compounds</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold
and unlock a new level of performance. You expect to make progress in a linear
fashion and it&#39;s frustrating how ineffective changes can seem during the first
days, weeks, and even months. It doesn&#39;t feel like you are going anywhere. This
is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. In order
to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break
this plateau what author calls the <em>Plateau fo Latent Potential.</em> If you find
yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because
you have lost your ability to improve. Its often because you have not yet
crossed the plateau of Latent Potential.</p>

<h4 id="headline-5">
FOREGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-5" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we ant in life is to
set specific actionable goals. What&#39;s the difference between system and goals?
Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes
that lead to those results.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar
business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run
marketing campaigns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and
focused only on your system, would you still succeed? Yes, the only way to
actually win is to get better each day. The score takes care of itself. Goals
are good for setting direction, but systems are best for making progress. A
handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals
and not enough time designing your systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>If all successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal
cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers.</p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That&#39;s the
counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our
results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to chage are
teh systems that cause those results. Fix the inputs and the ouputs will fix themselves.</p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: &#34;Once I reach my goal, then
I&#39;ll be happy.&#34;</p>
</div>
<p>
<strong>Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.</strong></p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The purpose of setting gaols is to win the game. The purpose of building systems
is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking.
It&#39;s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless
refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the
process that will determine your progress.</p>

A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-6" class="outline-text-4">
<p>If you&#39;re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn&#39;t you. The
problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again because you
don&#39;t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do
not rise to level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. This is
the meaning of phrase atomic habits- a regular practice or routine that is not
only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component
of the system of compound growth.</p>

</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-7" class="outline-text-3">
<p>It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days,
even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like
exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two
and then become a hassle.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

<li>
<p>We try to change the wrong thing.</p>

THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOUR CHANGE

changing your habits and systems: implementing a new routine at the gym,
decluttering your desk for a better workflow, developing a meditation
practice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The third and deepest layer is changing your identity.</strong> This level is
concerned with changing your beliefs: your worldview, your self-image, your
judgements about yourself and others. Most of beliefs, assumptions and biases
you hold are associated with this level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is
about what you believe. When it comes to building habits that last- when it
comes to building a system of 1 percent improvements- the problem is not that
one level is &#34;better&#34; or &#34;worse&#34; than another. All levels of change are useful
in their own way. Many people begin the process of changing their habits by
focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome based habits.
The alternative is to build identity based habits. With this approach, we start
by focusing on who we wish to become.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine two people resisting cigarettes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. The system of a
democracy is founded on beliefs like freedom, majority rule, and social
equality. The system of a dictatorship has a very different set of beliefs like
absolute authority and strict obidience. A similar pattern exists whether we are
discussing individuals, organizations or societies. There are a set of beliefs
and assumptions that shape the system, an identity behind the habits. Behaviour
that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more money, but if
your identity is someone who consumes rather than creates, then you will
continue to be pulled toward spending rather than earning. The ultimate form of
intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It&#39;s one
thing to say I&#39;m the type of person who wants this. It&#39;s something very
different to say I&#39;m the type of person who is this. True behaviour change is
identity change. You might start a habit because of motivation, but the only
reason you will stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity.</p>

</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Your behaviour are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an
indication of the type of person you believe you are- either consciously or
unconsciously. Once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity,
they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. The person who
incorporates exercise into their identity doesn&#39;t have to convince themselves to
train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behaviour and your
identity are fully alighned, you are no longer pursuing behaviour change. The
more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it
is to change it.</p>

THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-9" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Your habits are how you embody your identity. When you make your bed each day,
you embody the identity of an organized person. Whatever your identity is right
now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. If you go to church
every Sunday for twenty years, you have evidence that you are religious. Of
course, your habits are not the only action that influence your identitym but by
virtue of their frequency they are usually the most important ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and
deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No
single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does
the evidence of your new identity. The most practical way to change who you are
is to change what you do. It is a simple two-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Decide the type of person you want to be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prove it to yourself with small wins.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Many people are not sure where to begin- but they do know whay kind of results
they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double their
salary. Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of
person who could get those results.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>The first step is now what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be.
You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not

WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-11" class="outline-text-4">
<p>A habit is a behaviour that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Occasionaly, like a cat pressing on a lever, you stumble across a solution. You
are feeling anxious and you discover that going for a run calms you down. You&#39;re
mentally exhausted from a long day of work, and you learn that playing
videogames relaxes you. You are exploring, exploring, and then- BAM- a reward.
After you stumble upon an unexpected reward, you alter your strategy for next
time. Your brain immediately begins to catalog events that preceded the reward.
<em>Wait a minute- that felt good. What did I do right before that?</em> This is the
feedback loop behind all human behaviour: try, fail, learn, try differently.
Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-12" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-12">
THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-12" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The process of building habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue,
craving, response, and reward. Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can
help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it. This
four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs through
these steps in the same order each time.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to intitiate a behaviour.
It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. Your mind is continuously
analysing your internal and external environment for hinds of where rewards
are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we&#39;re close to a
reward, it naturally leads to a craving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every
habit. Without some level of motivation or desire- without craving a change-
we have no reason to act. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the
feeling of relief it provides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perfrom,
which can take the form of a thought or a action. Whether a response occurs
depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the
behaviour.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every
habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the
reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>they satisfy us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they teach us. which actions are worth remembering in the future.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>If a behaviour is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This four-step process is not something that happens occasionally, but rather it
is an endless feedback loop that is running and active during every moment you
are alive- even now. We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem
phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the
craving, and it is when you realise that something needs to change. The solution
phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and
achieve the change you desire. All behaviour is driven by the desire to solve a
problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to
obtain it. Sometimes problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to
relive it.</p>

The 1st Law: Make it Obvious
</h2>
<div id="outline-text-headline-16" class="outline-text-2">
<p>The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking in your
surroundings and analysing the information it comes across. Whenever you
experience something repeatedly- like a paramedic seeing the face of a heart
attack patient or a military analyst seeing a missile on a radar screen- your
brain begins noticing what is important, sorting through the details and
highlighting the relevant cues, and cataloging that information for future use.
With enough practice, you can pick up on the ques that predict certain outcomes
without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the
lessons learnt through experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are
doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be

5. The Best Way to start a New Habit
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-17" class="outline-text-3">
<p><strong>Create Implementation Intention:</strong>
Broadly speaking, the format of creating an implementation intention is: &#34;When
situation X arises, I will perform response Y.&#34; The punch line is clear: people
who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new babit are
more likely to follow through. Too many people try to change their habits
without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, &#34;I&#39;m going to eat
healthier&#34; or &#34;I&#39;m going to write more&#34;, but we never say when and where these
habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will &#34;just
remember to do it&#34; or feel motivated at the right time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It
is not obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire
lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The simplest way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this
sentence:
I will [BEHAVIOUR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p>
</div>
<p>
We often say yes to little requests because we are often not clear enough about
what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it&#39;s easy to
rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to specific
things you need to do to succeed.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-18" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-18">
HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-18" class="outline-text-4">
<p>No behaviour happens in isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the
next behaviour. Why is this important? When it comes to building new habits, you
can use the connectedness of behaviour to your advantage. One of the best ways
to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do everyday and
then stack your new behaviour on top. This is called habit stacking.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The habit stacking formula is:
&#34;After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].&#34;</p>
</div>
<p>
For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for
one minute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately change into my
workout clothes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your morning routine habit stacking might look like this:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my todo list for the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I write my todo list for the day, I will immediately begin with the
first task.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="headline-19">
6. Motivation is overrated; Environment Often matters more
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-19" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique
personalities, certain behavior tend to arise again and again under certain
environmental conditions. In church, people tend to talk in whispers. On a dark
street, people act wary and guarded. In this way, the most common form of change
is not internal, but externalL we are changed by the world around us. Every
habit is context dependent.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-20" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-20">
HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-20" class="outline-text-4">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put your pill
bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom counter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar stand in the
middle of the living room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a stack of
stationary on your desk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each morning and
place them in common locations around the house.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of
your environment. The most persistent behaviours usually have multiple cues. By
sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you
will think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best choice is the
most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and natural when the cues for
good habits are right in front of you.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-21" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-21">
THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-21" class="outline-text-4">
<p>For example, many people drink more in social situations than they would ever
drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation:
watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music at the bar, seeing the
beers on tap.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>We mentally assign our habits to the location in which they occur: the home, the
office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and
routines. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for an hour
each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television and eats
a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people have different memories- and
this different habits- associated with the same place.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can be easier to
change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle triggers and cues
that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a new place- a different coffee
shop, a bench in the park, a corner of your room you seldom use- and create a
new routine there. Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on
autopilot at your regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it
easier to avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn&#39;t automatically know where
it is located.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>When you can&#39;t manage to get to an entirely new environment, redefine or
rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for work, study, exercise
and entertainment. The mantra I find useful is &#34;One space, one use.&#34; Whenever
possible avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start
mixing contexts, you&#39;ll start mixing habits- and the easier ones will usually
win out. This is one reson why the versatility of modern technology is both a
strength and a weakness.</p>

7. The Secret to Self-Control
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-23" class="outline-text-3">
<p>When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it
turns out those individuals aren&#39;t all that different form those who are
struggling. Instead, &#34;disciplined&#34; people are better at structuring their lives
in a way that does not require heroic will power and self-control. In other
words, they spend less time in tempting situations. The people with the best
self control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It&#39;s easier to
practice restraint when you don&#39;t have to use it very often. So, yes,
perseverance, grit, and willpower are essential to success, but the way to
improve these qualities is not by wishing you were a more disciplined person,
but by creating a more disciplined environment.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the
feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because you eat
junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you
watch more television because you don&#39;t have energy to do anything else.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>You can break a habit, but you&#39;re unlikely to forget it.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>A reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you can&#39;t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a
few hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&#39;re continually feeling like you are not enough, stop following social
media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you are spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of
latest tech gear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Rather than <em>make it obvious,</em> you can <em>make it invisible.</em> Remove a single cue
and the entire habit often fades away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Self-control is a short term strategy, not a long-term one. You may be able to
resist temptation once or twice, but it&#39;s unlikely you can muster the willpower
to override your desires everytime. Instead of summoning a new dose of willpower
whenever you want to do right thing, your energy would be better spent
optimizing your environment. This is the secret to self-control. Make cues of
your good habits obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.</p>

</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-25" class="outline-text-3">
<p>If you want to increase the odds that a behaviour will occur, then you need to
make it attractive. While it is not possible to transform every habit into a
supernormal stimulus, we can make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must
start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>We begin by examining a boilogical signature that all habits share- the dopamine spike.</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-26" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-26">
THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-26" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is highly
habit-forming- taking drugs, eating junk food, playing videogames, browsing
social media- is associated with higher levels of dopamine. The same can be said
for our most basic habitual behaviours like eating food, drinking water, having
sex, and interacting socially. Dopamine is released not only when you experience
pleasure, but also when you anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine
spike right before they place a bet. Whenever your dopamine rises, so does your
motivation to act. The reward system that is activated in the brain when you
recieve a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a
reward. As a child, thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening
the gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be more
enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Your brain has far more neural
circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Desire is the engine that drives behaviour. Every action is taken because of the
anticipation that preceds it. It is the craving that leads to the response. We
need to make our habits attractive because it is the expectation of a rewarding
experience that motivates us to act in the first place.</p>

HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE

<div id="outline-text-headline-27" class="outline-text-4">
<p>You&#39;re more likely to find a behavior attracttive if you get to do one of your
favourite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the latest
celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you
could only read thte tabloids and watch reality shows at the gym.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known a Permack&#39;s
principle. It states that &#34;more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable
behaviors.&#34; Even if you don&#39;t really want to process overdue work emails,
you&#39;ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you
really want to do along the way. The habit stacking + temptation bundline formula
is:</p>

<p>After [CURRENTT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].</p>
</li>
<li>

THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS

<p>Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the
respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival.
We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or
school, our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and
groups comes with its own set of expectations and standards- when and whether to
get married, how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how much
money to spend on your child&#39;s birthday party. In many ways, these social norms
are the invisible rules that guide your behaviour each day. You are always
keeping them in mind. We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:</p>

1. Imitating the Close
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-30" class="outline-text-4">
<p>We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with each
other, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you give
it a try too. As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely
we are to imitate some of their habits. If one person in a relationship lost
weight, the other partner would also slim down about one third of the time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a
culture where your desired behaviour is the normal behaviour. New habits seem
achievable when you see others doing them everyday.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It transforms a
personal quest into a shared one. Previously you were on your own. Your identity
was singular. <em>You are a reader. You are a musician. You are an athelete.</em> When
you join a book club or a band or a cycling group, your identity becomes linked
to those around you. Growth and change is no longer a individual pursuit. <em>We
are readers.</em> The shared identity begins to reinforce your personal identity.</p>

<h4 id="headline-31">
2. Imitating the Many
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-31" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We
are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, &#34;What is everyone else
doing?&#34; We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to
imitate the &#34;best&#34; buying, eating and travel habits. It&#39;s usually a smart
strategy but there can be a downside. The normal behaviour of the trive often
overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. The human mind knows how to
get along with others. It wants to get along with others. This is our natural
mode. You can override it- you can choose to ignore the gorup or to stop caring
about what people think- but it takes work.</p>

<h4 id="headline-32">
3. Imitating the Powerful
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-32" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Humans everywhere pursue power, prestige, and status. We are drawn to behaviour
that earn us respect approval, admiration, and status. We want to be the one in
the gym who can do muscle-ups or the musician who can play the hardest chord
progressions. Once we fit in, we start looking for ways to stand out. This is
one reasy we care so much about the habits of highly effective people. High
status people enjoy the approval, respect, and praise of others. And that means
if a behaviour gets us these, we find it attractive. When our mother comes to
visit, we clean up house because we don&#39;t want to be judged. We are continually
wondering &#34;What will others think of me?&#34; and altering our behaviour based on
the answer.</p>

<h4 id="headline-34">
WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-34" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive. Some
of our underlying motives include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Conserve energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Obtain food and water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find love and reproduce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Connect and bond with others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Win social acceptance and approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduce uncertainity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Achieve status and prestige.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your
brain did not evolve with a desire to smoke cigarettes or to check Instagram or
to play videogames. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainity and
relive anxiety.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we
predict a habit to be worth repeating or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>CUE: You notice that the stove is hot.</p>
<p>
Prediction: If I touch it I&#39;ll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.</p>
</div>
<p>
You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the
appropriate responce. Life feels reactive, but its actually predictive. All day
long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you&#39;ve just seen
and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predecting what will
happen in the next moment. These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we
typically describe a craving- a feeling, a desire, an urge. A craving is the
sense that something is missing. It is the desire to change your internal state.
When the temperature falls, there is a gap between what your body is currently
sensing and what it wants to be sensing. This gap between your current state and
you desired state provides a reason to act.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Desire is the difference between where you are now and where you want ot be in
the future. Even the tiniest action is tinged with the motivation to feel
differently than you do in the moment.</p>

HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-35" class="outline-text-4">
<p>You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with
a positive experience. Sometimes all you need is a slight mindset shift. For
instance you think you have to wake up early for work. Now imagine changing just
one word: You don&#39;t &#39;have&#39; to. You &#39;get&#39; to. By simply changing one word, you
shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviours
as burdens and turn them into opportunties.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p><strong>Exercise.</strong> Many people associate exercies with being a challenging tasks that
 drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to
 develop skills and build you up. Instead of telling yourself &#34;I need to go run
 in the morning&#34;, say &#34;It&#39;s time to build endurance and get fast&#34;.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Say you want to feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truely
happy- like petting your dog or taking a bubble bath- and then create a short
routine that you perform everytime you do the thing you love. Maybe you take
three deep breaths and smile. Eventually you begin to associate this breathe and
smile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy.</p>

<p>It is easy to get bogged down to trying to find the optimal plan for change: the
fastest way to lose weight, the best program to build muscle, the perfect idea
for side hustle. We are so focused on figuring out the best approach that we
never get around to taking action. As Voltaire once wrote, &#34;The best is the

really, you are just preparing to get something done. When preparation becomes a
form of procrastination, you need to change something. You don&#39;t want to merely

HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-38" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Habit formation is the process by which a behaviour becomes progressively more
automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the
structure of your brain changes to become efficient in that activity. Each time
you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated
with that habit. This means that simply putting in your reps is one of the most
critical steps you can take to encoding a new habit. You should be asking how
many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic? There is nothing
magical about time passing with regard to habit formation. What matters is the
rate at which you perform the behaviour. It is the frequency that makes the
difference. To build a habit, you need to practice it. And the most effective
way to make practice happen is to adhere to the 3rd Law of Behaviour Change:
make it easy.</p>

<p>Conventional wisdom holds that motivation is the key to habit change. Maybe if
you really wanted it, you&#39;d actually do it. But the truth is, our real
motivation is to be lazy and do what is convenient. And despite what the latest
productivity best seller will tell you, this is a smart strategy, not a dumb
one. Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever
possible. It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort. We are motivated
to do what is easy.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Look at any behaviour that fills up much of your life and you&#39;ll see that it can
be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on your
phones, checking email, and watching television. They are remarkably convinient.
Every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an
obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling
is an obstacle to thinking clearly. If you make your good habits more
convenient, you&#39;ll be more likely to follow through on them.</p>

<p>Imagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Some water can
flow through but not very much. If you want to increase the rate at which water
passes through the hose, you have two options. The first option is to crank up
the valve, the second option is to simply remove the bend and let the water
flow through naturally. Trying to pump up your motivaition to stick with a hard
habit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it
requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile
making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend. Rather than trying
to overcome friction in your life, try to reduce it. If you look at the most
habit-forming products, you&#39;ll notice that one of the things these goods and
services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery
services reduce the friction of shopping groceries. Dating apps reduce the
friction of making social introductions. The central idea is to create

13. How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-42" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Researchers estimate that 40 to 50 percent of our actions on any given day are
out of habit. This is already a substantail percentage, but the true influence
of your habits is even greater than these numbers suggest. Habits are automatic
choices that influcene the conscious decisions that follow. Habits are like the
entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path, and before you know it,
you&#39;re speeding toward the next behaviour. Everyday, there are a handful of
moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as
decisive moments. The moment you choose between driving your car or riding your
bike. The moment you decide between starting your homework or grabbing the
videogame controller. These choices are fork in the road. We are limited by
where our habits lead us. This is why mastering the decisive moments throughout
your day is so important. Habits are the entry point, not the end point. They
are the cab, not the gym.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-43" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-43">
THE TWO-MINUTE RULE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-43" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The rule states, &#34;When you start a new habit, it should take less than two
minutes to do.&#34; You can scale any habit down to 2 minute version.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&#34;Read before bed at night&#34; becomes &#34;Read one page.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;Do thirty minutes of yoga&#34; becomes &#34;Take out my yoga mat.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;Study for class&#34; becomes &#34;Open my notes.&#34;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#34;Fold the laundry&#34; becomes &#34;Fold one pair of socks.&#34;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. A new habit should
not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the
first two minutes should be easy. People often think it&#39;s weird to get hyped
about reading one page or meditating for one minute. But the point is not to do
one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit
must be established before it can be improved. By doing the same warmup before
every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peek performance. By
developing a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a
reasonable time each night. Once you have established this habit, you can move
on to improve it further.</p>

commitment device is a choice you make in present that controls your actions in
the future. It is a way to lock in future behaviour, bind you to good habits,
and restrict bad ones. When Victor Hugo shut his clothes away so he could focus

There can be downsides to this too. I often find myself gravitating toward
social media during any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a
second, I reach for my phone. It&#39;s easy to write off these minor distractions as
&#34;just taking a break,&#34; but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue.

<h3 id="headline-48">
The Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-48" class="outline-text-3">
<p>We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. Take
the story of chewing gum. Chewing gum had been sold commercially throughout the
1800s, but it wasn&#39;t until Wrigley launched in 1891 that it became a world wide
habit. Early versions were made from relatively bland resins- chewy, but not
tasty. Wrigley revolutionized the industry by adding flavours like Spearmint and
Juicy Fruit, which made the product flavorful and fun to use. Stories like these
are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behaviour Change: <em>What is rewarded is
repeated.</em> <em>What is punished is rewarded.</em> But there is a trick. We are not
looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate
satisfaction.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-49" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-49">
THE MISMATCH BETWEEN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED REWARDS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-49" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Our ancestors spent their days responding to grave threats, securing the next
meal, and taking shelter from the storm. It made sense to place a high value on
instant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And after
thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved
to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones. You value the present more than the
future. Usually, this tendancy serves us well. A reward that is certain right
now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But
occasionaly, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why
would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity? Once
you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the
consequences of bad habits are delayed while rewards are immediate. Smoking
might kill you in 10 years, but it reduces stress and eases your nicotine
cravings now. Overeating is harmful in the long run but appetizing in the
moment. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the
ultimate outcome feels bad. It is opposite for good habits. Costs of your good
habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The brain&#39;s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can&#39;t rely on
good intentions. When you make a plan- to lose weight, write a book, or learn a
language- you are actually making plans for your future self. And when you
envision what you want your life to be like, it is easy to see the value in
taking actions with long term benefits. We all want better lives for our future
selves. However, when the moment of decision arrives, instant gratification
usually wins. As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an
action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long
term goals. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratisfaction.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-headline-50" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-50">
HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-50" class="outline-text-4">
<p>In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real
world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you
with something. The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to
remember it more than other phases. You want ending of your habit to be
satisfying. The best approach is to use <em>reinforcement,</em> which refers to the
process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of behavior.
Reinforcement ties your habit to an immediate reward, which makes it satisfying
when you finish. It can be helpful when dealing with <em>habits of aviodance,</em>
which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with
habits like &#34;no frivolous purchases&#34; because nothing happens when you don&#39;t buy
that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in
the first place. All you are doing is resisting temptation, and there isn&#39;t much
satisfying about that.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance
visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want- maybe
&#34;Leather Jacket.&#34; Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money
in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer Rs. 25. It&#39;s like creating a
loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money
toward the leather jacket feels a lot better than being deprived. You are
makeing it satisfying to do nothing. Buying a new jacket is fine if you are
trying to lose weight or read more books, but it doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re trying
to budget and save money. It is worth noting that it is important to select
short term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict
with you. Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and
reduced stress kick in, you&#39;ll become less concerned with chasing secondary
reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it&#39;s who
you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life,
the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start
a habit. Identity sustains a habit.</p>

<div id="outline-text-headline-53" class="outline-text-4">
<p>No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life
will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. Before long, an
emergency will pop up- you get sick or you have to travel for work or your
family needs a little more of your time. Whenever this happens, try to remind
yourself of a simple rule: never miss twice. If I miss one day, I try to get
back into it as quickly as possible. Missing one workout happens, but I&#39;m not
going to miss two in a row. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you.
It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident.
Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature
between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout,
or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly. The
breaking of a habit doesn&#39;t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast. Furthermore,
it&#39;s not always about what happens during the workout. It&#39;s about being the type
of person who doesn&#39;t miss workouts. It&#39;s easy to train when you feel good, but
it&#39;s crucial to show up when you don&#39;t feel like it- even if you do less than

KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-54" class="outline-text-4">
<p>The dark side of tracking a particular habit is that we become driven by the
number rather than the purpose behind it. The human mind wants to &#34;win&#34; whatever
game is being played. This pitfall is evident in many areas of life. We focus on
working long hours instead of getting meaningful work done. We care more about

wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior. Measurement is only useful when it
guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it consumes you. Each
number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.</p>

How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-55" class="outline-text-3">
<p>Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is
satisfying, we are more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is
painful. Pain is an effective teacher. If a failure is painful, it gets fixed.
The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from
it. As soon as actions incure an immediate consequence, behavior begins to
change. Customers pay their bills on time when they are charged a late fee.
Students show up to calss when their grade is linked to attendance. To be
productive, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action.
To be healthy, the cost of laziness must be greater than the cost of exercise.
Behavior only shifts if the punishment is painful enough and reliably enforced.
Thankfully, there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any bad
habit: create a <em>habit contract.</em></p>

THE HABIT CONTRACT
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-56" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Law and regulations are an example of how government can change our habits by
creating a social contract. Take example of helmet and seat-belt laws. Just as
governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit
contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written
agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the
punishment that will occur if you don&#39;t follow through. Then you find one or two
people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.</p>

18. The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don&#39;t)
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-58" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of
competition. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with,
when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Embracing this
strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people are born with
different abilities. The strenght of genetics is also their weakness. Genes
cannot easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in
favorable curcumstances and serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.
The people at the top of any competitive field are not only well trained, they
are well suited for the task. And that is why, if you want to be truly great,
selecting the right place is to focus is crucial.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>In short: genes do not determine your destiny. They determine your areas of
opportunity. Genes can predispose, but they don&#39;t predetermine. The areas where
you are genetically predisposed to success are the areas where habits are more
likely to be satisfying. The key is to direct your effort toward ares that both
excite you and match your natural skills, to align your ambition with your
ability. The question is then, &#34;How to identify the opportunities?&#34;.</p>

HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-59" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation
to situation. The most proven scientific analysis of personality is known as the
&#34;Big Five&#34;, which breaks down to five spectrums of behavior.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one and to cautious and
consistent on the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm and stable.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All five characteristics have biological underpinnings, can be tracked from
birth. As an example consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all
people posses to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be
anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been linked to
hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for
noticing threats. In other words, people who are more sensitive to negative cues
in their environment are more likely to score high in neuroticism.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Our habits are nto solely determined by our personalities, but there is no doubt
that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences
make certain behaviours easier for some people than for others. You don&#39;t have
to apologize for these differences or feel guilty for them, but you do have to
work with them. The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your
personality. If your friend follows a low-carb diet but you find that low-fat
works for you, then more power to you. Read whatever fascinates you. You don&#39;t
have to build the habits everyone tells you to build.</p>

HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOUR
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-60" class="outline-text-4">
<p>How do you pick the right habit? In the long-run, if you continue to advance and
improve, any area can become challenging. At some point, you need to make sure
you&#39;re playing the right game for your skillset. How do you figure that out?</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>The most common approach is trial and error. But life is short. There is an
effective way to manage this conundrum, and that is explore/exploit trade-off.
In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In
relationships, it&#39;s called dating. In college it&#39;s called the liberal arts. The
goal is to try out many possibilites, research a broad range of ideas, and cast
a wide net. After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the
best solution you&#39;ve found- but keep experimenting occasionally. If you are
currently winning, you exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you
continue to explore, explore, explore. In the long-run it is probably effective
to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80-90
percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent.</p>
</div>
<p>
As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask
yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be
satisfying to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What makes me loose track of time?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where do I get greater returns than average person?</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>What naturally comes to me?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you can&#39;t win by being better, you can win by being different. Boiling
water will soften will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can&#39;t control
whether you&#39;re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it&#39;s
bette to be hard or soft.</p>

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-61" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Biological differences matter. Even so, it&#39;s more productive to focus on whether
you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else.
The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do
with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capacity. People get so caught
up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effor required
to get close to them. Furthuremore, genes can&#39;t make you successful if your&#39;re
not doing the work. Yes, it&#39;s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has
better genes, but if you haven&#39;t put in the same reps, it&#39;s impossible to say if
you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as
those you admire, don&#39;t explain away their success as luck.</p>

19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-62" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working
on tasks that are right on the edge of their abilities. Not too hard. Not too
easy. Just right. When you are starting a new habit, it&#39;s important to keep
behaviour as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions
aren&#39;t perfect. Once a habit has been established, however it is important to
continue to advance in small ways. These improvements and new challenges keep
you engaged. And if you git the Goldilocks Zone just rihgt, you can achieve a
flow state. A flow state is the experience of being in the zone and fully
immersed in an activity. Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to
regularly search for challenges that push you to your edge while continuing to
make enough progress to stay motivated. Behaviours need to remain novel in
order for them to stay attractive and satisfying. Without variety, we get bored.
And boredom is perhaps the greatest villian on the quest for self-improvement.</p>
<div id="outline-container-headline-63" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="headline-63">
HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON YOUR GOALS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-63" class="outline-text-4">
<p>At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training everyday,
doing the same lifts over and over and over. Really successful people feel the
same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find
a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom. Mastery requires practice. But
the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. The
greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits
because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. As soon as we
experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy-
even if the old one was still working. I can guarentee that if you manage to
start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like
quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don&#39;t feel like
showing up. Whne you are at the gym, there will be sets that you don&#39;t feel like
finishing. When it&#39;s time to write there will be days tat you don&#39;t feel like
typing. But stepping up when it&#39;s annoying or painful or draining to do so,
that&#39;s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.</p>

<p>Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose;
amateurs get pulled of course by urgencies in life.</p>

20. The Downside of Creating Good Habits
</h3>
<div id="outline-text-headline-64" class="outline-text-3">
<p>The benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops
fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as habit becomes automatic, you become less
sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition. It becomnes easier to
let mistakes slide. When you can do it &#34;good enough&#34; on autopilot, you stop
thinking about how to do it better.</p>
<div class="center-block" style="text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
<p>Habits are necessary but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a
combination of automatic habits and deliberate practice.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. But after one habit
ahs been mastered, you have to return to the efforful part of the work and begin
building the next habit. Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a
tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and
then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of
your development. Old tasks become easier the second time around, but it doesn&#39;t
get easier overall because you are pouring your energy into the next challenge.
Each habit unlocks the next level of performance. It&#39;s an endless cycle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of your
performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve.</p>

HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS
</h4>
<div id="outline-text-headline-65" class="outline-text-4">
<p>Reflection and review enables the long-term improvement of all habits because it
makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible pahts for
improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations,
and like to overselves. Improvements is not just about learning habits, it&#39;s
about fine-tuning them. Reflection and review ensures that you spend your time
on the right things and make course corrections whenever necessary. You don&#39; t
want to keep practicing a habit if it becomes ineffective.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reflections and review offers an ideal time to revisit one of the most important
aspects of behaviour change: identity.</p>

<p>The schoolteacher who ignores innovative teaching methods and sticks with her
tried-and-true lesson plans. The veteran manager who is commited to doing things
&#34;his way&#34;. The tighter we cling to an identity, the harder it becomes to grow
beyond it. One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of of your identity
an overwhelming portion of who you are. The more you let a single belief define
you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you tie
everthing up in being the point guard or the parter at the firm or whatever
else, then the loss of that facet of your life will wreck you. If you&#39;re a vegan
and then develop a health condition that forces you to change your diet, you&#39;ll
have an identity crisis on your hands. Military veterans and forer entrepreneurs
report similar feelings. The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to
redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity
even if your particular role changes.</p>

<p>Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into
